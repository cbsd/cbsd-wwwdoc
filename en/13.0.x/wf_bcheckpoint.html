	<div class="block">

<p>To use this feature the kernel (vmm.ko module) and bhyve userland utilites must be compiled with BHYVE_SNAPSHOT flags. Please add into /etc/src.conf:</p>
	<pre class="cli;">
WITH_BHYVE_SNAPSHOT=yes
</pre>
	<p>And add into kernel config file:</p>
        <pre class="cli;">
options         BHYVE_SNAPSHOT
</pre>
	<p>Then rebuild the world/kernel.</p>
	<p>The functionality of checkpoints and suspend of a virtual machine is the freezing of the virtual environment, saving the entire state to disk, from which you can return the system to its previous state without having to reboot the environment<p>
	<h2>Checkpoints</h2>
	<p>In <strong>CBSD</strong> to work with checkpoints use the <strong>bcheckpoint</strong> command, which has the following syntax:</p>
	<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
	cbsd bcheckpoint [jname=] [mode=] [name=] [poweroff=]
	</pre>
	<p>where:</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>- <strong>jname</strong>: (required) the name of the environment, for example: freebsd1</li>
		<li>- <strong>mode</strong>: (required) action relative to the environment: create (create checkpoint), list (list of checkpoints created), destroyall (destroy all checkpoints)</li>
		<li>- <strong>name</strong>: (optional) specify an alternate checkpoint name, by default: checkpoint</li>
		<li>- <strong>poweroff</strong>: (optional). When poweroff=1, <strong>CBSD</strong> will automatically shut down the virtual machine instantly
		(via <a href="/<!--#echo var="lang" -->/<!--#echo var="version" -->/wf_bstop_bstart_ssi.html">bstop</a> <strong>noacpi=1</strong>) on the fact of checkpoint creation.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Having created checkpoints, you can return to the desired state via the command <strong>bstart</strong> with <strong>checkpoint</strong> args</p>
