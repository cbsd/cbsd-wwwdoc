		<strong>Description:</strong>
		<p>The virtual machine is created on a pre-formed configuration file through <strong>cbsd bcreate jconf=path_to_cfg</strong>.</p>
		<p>For the configuration process, you can use the script <strong>cbsd bconstruct-tui</strong>, or use WEB interface.</p>
		<p>To create a via DIALOG:</p>
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler=true;">
		% cbsd bconstruct-tui
		</pre>
		<p>The same menu is available to create a jail when configuring <strong>CBSD</strong> via bsdconfig</p>
		<p class="text-center"><img src="/img/cbsd_syntax3.png" alt="" /></p>
		<p>If <strong>bconstruct-tui</strong> worked correctly, at the end you will be asked to create a virtual machine. In the case of  positive response, <strong>bcreate</strong> will be made to the new configuration automatically. Otherwise,  script displays the path to the configuration file (in <em>$workdir/tmp</em>), on which you can create a VM.</p>

	<h2><a name="bhyve_profiles">Virtual Machine Profiles</a></h2>
	<div class="block">
	<p>Profiles that come with <strong>CBSD</strong> and on which systems determine the URL from which the ISO image is downloaded, 
	placed in the catalog <em>~workdir/etc/defaults/</em> and start with the prefix <strong>vm-</strong></p>. For example, you can see the profiles list by command:</p>
	<pre class="brush:bash;ruler=true;">
% ls -1 ~cbsd/etc/defaults | grep ^vm-
vm-dflybsd-x86-5.conf
vm-freebsd-FreeBSD-x64-11.1.conf
vm-freebsd-FreeBSD-x64-12.0-LATEST.conf
vm-freebsd-FreeNAS-x64-11.conf
vm-freebsd-pfSense-2-RELEASE-amd64.conf
vm-linux-CentOS-7.4-x86_64.conf
vm-linux-Debian-x86-9.conf
vm-linux-fedora-server-26-x86_64.conf
	</pre>
	<p>Since the <strong>CBSD</strong> releases come out much less often than the versions of the various distributions, these profiles may expire quickly enough, and as a result, the image becomes inaccessible by the old links. </p>
	<p> In order not to get into similar situations and get new profiles, you can update them separately from <strong>CBSD</strong> with the Makefile in the <em>~workdir/etc</em> directory. There are two commands in the Makefile (you will see them if you just write make in this directory): </p>
	<ul>
		<li> make profiles-create  - is done once by starting the git repository from the GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/cbsd/cbsd-vmprofiles" target="_blank">https://github.com/cbsd/cbsd-vmprofiles</a></li>
		<li> make profiles-update  - is done every time (after profiles-create) when you want to update profiles</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Since these operations are used by git, you must first install it in the system: pkg install devel/git (or from the ports: make -C /usr/ports/devel/git install)</p>
	<p>For example:</p>
	<pre class="brush:bash;ruler=true;">
% cd ~cbsd/etc
% make profiles-create
% make profiles-update
	</pre>
	<div class="warning">
	<p>If you notice that some version of the profile is out of date and in the repository <a href="https://github.com/cbsd/cbsd-vmprofiles" target="_blank">https://github.com/cbsd/cbsd-vmprofiles</a> no one sent a correction, you can contribute <strong>CBSD</strong> by sending changes (in the old profile or creating a new one)
	independently through Pull Request, having an account on github.com</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	<h2><a name="custom_bhyve_profiles">Creating your own virtual machine profiles</a></h2>
	<div class="block">
	<p> If your desired OS profile is missing from the <strong>CBSD</strong> distribution, or for some reason you are unsatisfied, you can create your profile by analogy with an existing one </p>
	<p> Custom profiles must be located in the <em>~cbsd/etc</em> directory (for example, <em>/usr/jails/etc</em>), while the original <strong>CBSD</strong> profiles are in directory <em>~cbsd/etc/defaults</em> (for example, <em>/usr/jails/etc/defaults</em>)</p>
	<p> If you edit files in the <em>~cbsd/etc/defaults</em> directory, all your changes will be deleted each time you update <strong>CBSD</strong></p>
	<p> If you want to overwrite the original profile, just copy it to the <em>~cbsd/etc</em> directory and edit it. In this case, with the same profile names, the system will always prefer the profile
	from the <em>~cbsd/etc</em> directory, despite its presence in the <em>~cbsd/etc/defaults</em> directory. </p>
	<p> When creating a new profile, please observe the following rules: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>the file name must begin with vm-"os-type"-XXX.conf, where os-type - type of OS, e.g: freebsd, openbsd, linux, windows, other</li>
		<li>Inside the profile this arguments are mandatory: <strong>long_description</strong>, <strong>vm_profile</strong> и <strong>vm_os_type</strong></li>
	<ul>
	<p>Where:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>long_description</strong> contains an arbitrary description, for example: long_description="Linux Debian 9.2.1"</li>
		<li><strong>vm_os_type</strong> - contains the OS type and must also be in the file name. So, if the OS type is linux, write: vm_os_type="linux", and the profile file will begin with <strong>vm-linux-</strong></li>
		<li><strong>vm_profile</strong> - the name of the profile, which also forms part of the profile file name. For example, if you created a profile for Debian 9.2.1, you can write vm_profile="Debian-9.2.1", and the full name of the profile file will be: vm-linux-<strong>Debian-9.2.1</strong>.conf</li>
	</ul>
	<p> The remaining parameters are optional (as the number of cores, RAM, the default virtual machine name, various bhyve settings), and if they are not in the profile, common values ​​will be used from <em>etc/defaults/bhyve-default-default.conf</em>, which
	you can also copy it to <em>etc/bhyve-default-default.conf</em> if the global parameters do not suit you and you want to edit them </p>
	<p> Also, look at the <strong>fetch</strong>, <strong>iso_img</strong>, <strong>register_iso_name</strong>, and <strong>register_iso_as</strong> options. </p>
	<p> If you create a virtual machine profile that you can retrieve over the network, you will most likely need them. </p>
	<p> fetch says <strong>CBSD</strong> whether an ISO image is available for download (0-no, 1-yes) </p>
	<p> iso_img points to the name of the ISO image, as it is called from the source where to download it (for example, ubuntu-17.04-server-amd64.iso) </p>
	<p> The parameters register_iso_name and register_iso_as control how to save the image to be downloaded and under what name to register in <strong>CBSD</strong> media, for example:
	<pre class="cli;">
register_iso_name="cbsd-iso-ubuntu-17.04-server-amd64.iso"
register_iso_as="iso-Ubuntu-Server-17.04"
</pre>
	</p>
	<p> If an ISO image is downloaded from the site, but an archive with an ISO image, for example <strong>.tgz</strong> or <strong>.gz</strong> or <strong>.xz</strong> etc. (for example, the <strong>vm-dflybsd - </strong> profile), you can specify the command to unzip, using the <strong>iso_extract</strong> parameter, for example: </p>
	<pre class="cli;">
iso_extract="bzip2 -d "
	</pre>
	<p>And of course, it's always useful to see how original images are written, the profile of which can be taken as a basis. </p>
	<div class="warning">
	<p>If you created a working OS profile, you can send it to the repository <a href="https://github.com/cbsd/cbsd-vmprofiles" target="_blank">https://github.com/cbsd/cbsd-vmprofiles</a> having an account on GitHub, thereby making other users <strong>CBSD</strong> happy. Also, this profile will be included in the next release of <strong>CBSD</strong> and you will become participant of the project!</p>
