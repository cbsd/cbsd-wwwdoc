	<h1><span>What you need to know about <strong>CBSD</strong></span></h1>
	<h2><a name="knowit">General information</a></h2>
	<div class="block">
    <p><strong>CBSD</strong> is an additional layer of abstraction for the 
    <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=jail&amp;sektion=8" target="_blank">jail(8)</a>
    framework, and provides additional functionality not currently available in
    FreeBSD.
    </p>
    <p>The additional functionality <strong>CBSD</strong> provides uses the 
    following;
    </p>
		<ul>
			<li>vnet (VIMAGE)</li>
			<li>zfs</li>
			<li>racct/rctl</li>
			<li>ipfw</li>
			<li>pf/ipfw/ipfilter</li>
			<li>carp</li>
			<li>hastd</li>
			<li>bhyve</li>
		</ul>
    <p>While many of these subsystems are not directly related to 
    <strong>jails</strong>, <strong>CBSD</strong> uses these components to 
    provide system administrators a more advanced, integrated system in which 
    to implement solutions for issues faced in today's envirnonment. 
    </br>
    This page will provide information to help system administrators familiarize 
    themselves with CBSD. While this page is not intended to be a comprehensive, 
    all encompassing how-to, it will provide details about where files are 
    stored, and how to use <strong>CBSD</strong> to manage and interact with 
    the virtual environment.
    </p>
    <p>The information provided here assumes a basic understanding of jails, 
    how they are used, and how they are managed in FreeBSD. The official 
    documentation about jails is a highly recommended starting point, and can be 
    found in Chapter 14 of the FreeBSD Handbook: 
    <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/jails.html" target="_blank">Jails</a>.
    The <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=jail&amp;sektion=8" target="_blank">jail(8)</a>
    manpage is also a great resource.
    </p>
    <p>Before getting started, be aware of the following terminology, and how 
    it will be used;
    </p>
		<ul>
      <li><strong>Node</strong>: A physical server that hosts the virtual 
      environment.</li>
      <li><strong>Jail</strong>: An isolated environment, complete  with its own 
      set of software and services. A jail is able to run any software that is 
      available to the OS installed in the jail (cli or graphical).</li> 
      <li><strong>Cloud:</strong> A farm/cluster of interconnected nodes, or a 
      full-fledged peer network (each node can do other tasks through <strong>CBSD</strong>)</li>
      <li><strong>Base:</strong> In the context of <strong>CBSD</strong>, a copy 
      of the files in the FreeBSD base.</li>
      <!--The description for what 'Base' is needs to be worded better.-->
      <li><strong>CBSD:</strong> An entity that has control over the specified 
      node(s) and certain subsystems of FreeBSD. CBSD provides a unified way to 
      interact with and perform actions on the specified nodes or jails via the 
      provided API. <strong>CBSD</strong> also provides the ability to implement 
      and use <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/fs-acl.html" target="blank"> ACL</a>, 
      and change permissions on specified resources.</li>
      <li><strong>$workdir:</strong> The working directory on a <strong>CBSD</strong> 
      node that is initialized via the <em>cbsd initenv</em> command on the 
      initial run. This directory is <strong>/usr/jails</strong> unless otherwise 
      specified.</li>
      <li><strong>$jname:</strong> The name of a jail in the <strong>CBSD</strong> 
      environment.</li>
<!--TODO: 1
    Can (should?) be descriptive. Jail names are limited to n characters, and can 
    only be alphanumeric.
-->
    </ul>
    <p>
      A quick word about jails. As stated, most any software available to the 
      OS the jail runs can be ran inside of a jail. Server-side components such 
      as DNS, Apache/nginx, or postfix, can run isolated from the host. Perhaps 
      lesser known is graphical environments/applications can also run inside a 
      jail isolated from the host. For example, run an XServer or VNCServer, 
      then connect to it. A single application can be run from inside a jail, 
      and then connected to using Xforwarding. <em>firefox -display=REMOTEADDR:PORT</em> 
      There is also 
      <a href="https://www.bsdstore.ru/en/xorg_in_jail.html" target="blank">xjails</a>, 
      Xorg running inside a jail isolated from the host.
    </p>
    <p>The largest directory used by CBSD is where all of the data <strong>CBSD</strong> 
    uses is stored. This is the directory <strong>$workdir</strong>, and is a 
    symlink to <strong><em>/usr/jails</em></strong> by default. This directory 
    can be changed when necessary. $workdir is also the <strong>CBSD</strong> 
    user's home directory. To quickly enter this dir from any other path, pass 
    '~cbsd' to the <strong>cd</strong> command.
    </p>
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
			% cd ~cbsd
		</pre>
    <p>
    There are two main directories used to store jail data. The deciding factor 
    for which directory is used depends on whether or not a newly created jail 
    should be able to write to it's base or not. This option is specified by 
    passing the flag <strong>baserw=0 or baserw=1</strong> when creating a new
    jail.
    </p>
    <p><u><strong>baserw=0;</strong></u></br>
    To create a jail with a readonly base, pass the flag <strong>baserw=0</strong>.
    Instead of writing to the base, the new jail will use the standard 
    base from <em>$workdir/basejail/$basename</em>. Jails with a read only 
    base are stored in the directory <strong><em>$workdir/jails/$jname</em></strong>.
    Any baserw=0 jail will mount the $basename through nullfs. This allows for 
    the easy upgrade of all baserw=0 jails, as upgrading the $basename jail 
    upgrades all of the jails using it. Another advantage is the fact that if a 
    read only jail is compromised, the attacker will be unable to modify anything 
    in base as it is read only.
    </p>
    <p><u><strong>baserw=1;</strong></u>
    When a new jail is created with the flag <strong>baserw=1</strong>, the jail 
    will have the ability to write to it's own base. Jails with this ability 
    store data in the directory <strong><em>$workdir/jails-data/$jname</em></strong>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>CBSD</strong> uses the standard directories specified by jail(8). 
    This allows jails to migrated to or from any other jail management system 
    that also follows the standards set by jail. The goal for the directories where 
    jails are stored is to be consistent, and adhere to the jail standards. This 
    allows for the greatest compatibility.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> When using the jail type md, the directory $workdir/jails-data/$jname 
    will contain the image of the jail.
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> When using ZFS, CBSD has the ability to unmount a jail's 
    data directory while the the jail is inactive. If a jail's data directory 
    is found to be empty, don't panic. (At least when the jail is inactive). 
    Check the output of the command;
    </p>
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
			% zfs list
		</pre>
    <p>To access the data use;
    </p>
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
			% zfs mount $jname_file_system
    </pre>
    </br>
    <p>The second-largest directory in the <strong>CBSD</strong> hierarchy is 
    <em>$workdir/var/db/</em>. This directory is where the configuration files 
    for all of the jails created are stored. All jail settings are stored in the 
    <strong>jails</strong> table in an SQLite3 database. The symbolic link 
    <em>${workdir}/var/db/local.sqlite</em> should always point to the correct/ 
    current database. The table schema is described in the file 
    <em>${workdir}/share/local-jails.schema</em>. SQLite3 can be used to query 
    information about all jails on a node. </br> 
    For example, to see all jails on the node, and their IP address' execute;</p>
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
			% sqlite3 /usr/jails/var/db/local.sqlite "select jname,ip4_addr from jails"
		</pre>
    <p>The <em>$workdir/jails-system/</em> directory serves as additional 
    storage for <strong>CBSD</strong> jail data.</br> 
    <u>For example:</u> There may be configurator's services, files with the description 
    of the jails, traffic statistics, resources statistics, and so on.</br>
    Internal information for <strong>CBSD</strong> is stored in the $workdir/db directory.</br>
    <u>For example:</u> The information on the list of added nodes, inventory of both 
    the local and remote nodes, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>One important thing to note in regards to security are the directories 
    <strong><em>${workdir}/.rssh</em> and <em>${workdir}/.ssh</em></strong>. 
    These dirs contain the private RSA keys for the remote user <strong>CBSD</strong>
    nodes (.rssh) and the local nodes(.ssh). Make sure that the data in these 
    directories are not available to other users of the system. For more 
    information, please see the article about 
    <a href="/en/cbsd_geli.html"> GELI encryption</a>. By default, the key can 
    be read only by a system <strong>CBSD</strong> user. 
    </p>
    Finally, be sure to read about the modifications that <strong>CBSD</strong> 
    does to the system. This <a href="/en/custom_freecbsd.html">page</a> describes 
    all of the modifications that are carried out by <strong>CBSD</strong> 
    scripts after installing on a FreeBSD system.

<h2><a name="traffic">Counting jail traffic</a></h2>
    <div class="block">
    <p><strong>CBSD</strong> uses the <strong>count</strong> ruleset of 
    <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/firewalls-ipfw.html"><strong>ipfw</strong></a> 
    filter to count jail traffic. <strong>CBSD</strong> sets the number of counters 
    in the <strong>99 — 2000</strong> range. The range can be easily adjusted in 
    cbsd.conf if this interfes with existing rules. Be mindful when changing 
    firewall rules. <strong>CBSD</strong> "takes ownership" of the rules in the 
    range given. In otherwords, if there are other rules already in place using 
    the specified range, there is the posibility that <strong>CBSD</strong> could 
    delete and re-add the rules in the range. This means all rules in the range 
    would be deleted, but only the <strong>CBSD</strong> rules would be added 
    back in.

	<h2><a name="secrsyncd"><span>About rsync-based copying jail data between nodes</span></a></h2>
	<div class="block">
     <p><strong>CBSD</strong> offers a wrapper to rsync called cbsdrsyncd. If 
     <strong>cbsdrsyncd</strong> is activated, please keep in mind that there 
     is the standard <strong>rsyncd(1)</strong> daemon running that looks at 
     the specified <em>$jail-data</em> directory, and is protected by the rsync 
     password. <strong>CBSD</strong> generates a strong password via the 
     following command;
     </p>
		 <pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
		 head -c 30 /dev/random | uuencode -m - | tail -n 2 | head -n1
		 </pre>
     <p><strong>CBSD</strong> transmits data through the rsync daemon over 
     port 1873/tcp. Please secure this port from any traffic excpet for remote 
     <strong>CBSD</strong>, or use encrypted communication between the nodes

	<div class="block">
    <p><strong>CBSD</strong> displays output using colorized text by default

    If the colors are found to be unpleasant, or interfere with using output 
    from commands or utilities available in <strong>CBSD</strong>, colors can 
    be disabled by setting the environment variable NOCOLOR=1.</br>
    For example, issuing the command;
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
