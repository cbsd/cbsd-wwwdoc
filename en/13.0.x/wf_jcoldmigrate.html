		<strong>Description</strong>:
	<p><strong>cbsd jcoldmigrate</strong> does cold (with stoping) migration jail from one node to another. Argmument <strong>node</strong> point for destination node. Preliminary, RSA/DSA key for remote node must be added via <strong>cbsd node mode=add</strong> operation. Also, on a remote node service rsyncd should work (<strong>cbsdrsync</strong>).</p>
	<p>By default, the jail status on a new node is inherited&nbsp;— if the jail worked, it also will be automatically started on a new node. If the jail didn't work&nbsp;— remains in Off status. To operate, what status should be on a remote jail not is dependent on a condition on the original, it is possible through parameter <strong>start</strong>.</p>
	<p>Jail on the source, after successful <strong>jcoldmigrate</strong> will be stoped and switch to <strong>Slave</strong> status (unregister).  In rc.conf file of jail on the destination node there will be a record where this jail came from.</p>
	<p>Notes: For jcoldmigrate, the next action is performed (in process they pass automatically and aren't visible)</p>
	<ul>
		<li>copy configuration files to remote node, status of jail set to Slave on remote node (<strong>cbsd j2prepare</strong>)
		<li>exec rsync, which does a full copy of the directory with data to remote node (<strong>cbsd j2slave</strong>)
		<li>stop jails (if running) on the source node (<strong>cbsd j2slave</strong>)
		<li>one more rsync job, for synchronization of those files which be modified
		<li>switch jail status on source to Slave (<strong>cbsd jswmode</strong>)
		<li>switch jail status to master on the remote node (<strong>cbsd rexe + jswmode</strong>)
		<li>If jail was running&nbsp;— start jail on remode node (<strong>cbsd rexe + cbsd jstart</strong>)
	</ul>
