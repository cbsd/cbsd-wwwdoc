			% cbsd jexport
		</pre>
		<p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>
		<div class="warning">
			<p><strong>Attention:</strong> command execution allows on jail in status <strong>On</strong>. However it is necessary to remember (especially for jail with databases) when you import such jails, with a high probability it is possible to got problems with inconsistency filesystem in jails, old .pid files that can break work of the imported jails</p>
		</div>
		<p>Export jail into file (*.img). In  <strong>jname</strong> arguments you can set jail for export. img-file stored in <i><strong>$workdir/export</strong></i> directory. Original jail  after exports is not modified</p>
		<p>You can control compress level via <strong>compress</strong> arguments</p>
		<p>CBSD use <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/xz/1" target="_blank">xz(1)</a>, tools for compress images and you can learn in man page about compress diffrence between compress level.</p>
		<p>By default CBSD use <strong>compress=6</strong>. You can disable compression with <strong>compress=0</strong></a>
		<p><strong>Example</strong> (export mysqljail jail to  $workdir/export/mysqljail.img):</p>
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
			% cbsd jexport jname=mysqljail
		</pre>

	<h2><a name="jexport_exclude"><span>Exceptions for jexport</span></a></h2>
	<div class="block">
		<p>There are situations where you do not want to include one or another information from the container in the exported image. 
		For example, if you are exporting a working container having a mounted port of ports in /usr/ports.</p>
		<p>In this case, you can help the <strong>jexport_exclude</strong> parameter, which can be specified globally in the jexport.conf configuration file 
		(just copy default jexport.conf from <em>/usr/local/cbsd/etc/defaults/</em>  to <em>~cbsd/etc/</em> and adjust the value for <strong>jexport_exclude</strong></p>
		<p>If you want to specify alternative exclude for a specific Jail, copy this file to the <em>~cbsd/jails-system/<strong>$jname</strong>/etc</em> / directory. 
		In this case, when you make an <strong>jexport</strong> call, these exceptions will be applied for <strong>$jname</strong> container only.</p>
		<p>Finally, you can do exclude without a configuration file at all, just listing all exceptions (space separated) as the <strong>jexport_exclude=</strong> parameter when calling the <strong>jexport</strong> script, for example:</p>
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
			cbsd jexport jname=jail1 jexport_exclude="/var/run/* /usr/ports"
		</pre>
		<p>In this example, ports tree  directory will not copy to image: since this data can always be mounted from the host.
		And also, eliminates the presence of dead <strong>.pid</strong> files that can affect the correctness of the launch of the container's services after importing.</p>
		<p>Exceptions are indicated relative to the root directory of the container. 
		So, if you want to migrate to another host <strong>jail1</strong> container configuration using jexport/jimport and do not want to copy any of its data, simply specify <strong>/</strong> as an exception:</p>
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
			cbsd jexport jname=jail1 jexport_exclude="/"
		</pre>
		<p class="text-center"><img src="/img/jexport1.png" alt="" /></p>
