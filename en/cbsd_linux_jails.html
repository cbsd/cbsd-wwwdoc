	<div class="block">
		<p><strong>CBSD</strong> supports Linux Jails (through Linuxulator) and has a script for creating containers based on CentOS, Ubuntu and Debian distributions.</p>
		<p>Of course, due to Linuxulator's restrictions, you will have to test the work of services in such containers very well, 
		so the <strong>CBSD</strong> authors support this possibility is provided, but the production installations are better to deploy in a Bhyve virtual machine, with which 
		<storng>CBSD</strong> also helps you.
		<p>An example of creating Linux containers via CLI:</p>
		<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
 cbsd jcreate jname=deb jprofile=debian_buster allow_raw_sockets=1
 cbsd jcreate jname=ubu jprofile=ubuntu_focal allow_raw_sockets=1
 cbsd jcreate jname=cent jprofile=centos_7 allow_raw_sockets=1
		</pre>
		<p>When the container first start, the script will work out, which will receive all the necessary distribution files from the Internet. Cache will be saved in the
		<strong>~cbsd/share/jail-*-rootfs</strong> directory, depending on the distribution.
