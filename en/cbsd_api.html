<p><strong>CBSD</strong> allows the user to create environments at different levels of abstraction 
by providing a large number of methods for creating environments - <a href="/<!--#echo var="lang" -->/cbsdfile.html"><strong>CBSDfile</strong></a>, 
[jb]create commands, which work both in the configuration file and through command line arguments. 
Finally, you can use interactive dialog menus ([jb]construct-tui). Despite the variety, 
all of these options require the login to the server each time via SSH to enter the respective commands.

The RestAPI service adds another option for managing environments for you, eliminating the need to use ssh, where you interact with the CBSD framework via HTTP / RestAPI requests or through a thin client.
Unlike other methods, this level of abstraction solves the following problems:
<ul>
	<li>Fully remote control: the client does not need to enter the server and even have an account on the server;</li>
	<li>Forget about physical servers in general - it does not matter how many physical servers in the cloud. Stop thinking about it. 
	Work with one input point that will solve all the problems on the placement of the environment for you;</li>
	<li>Unified Interface - RestAPI (unlike <strong>CBSD</strong>) Many specialists know;</li>
	<li>Separation of environments on independent namespaces - you can setup a <strong>CBSD</strong> cluster and provide access to the API to your friends or colleagues, 
	where no one will interfere with each other. Each user works only with their environments;</li>
	<li>Three (!) works with a cluster/API method are officially supported: platform-dependent - <strong>CBSDFile</strong> (requires <strong>CBSD</strong> as a subtle client) and two independent: 
	<strong>nubectl</strong> (client available on all modern platforms: Linux, Windows, MacOS) and any curl-like HTTP client with JSON as a payload;</li>
	<li>Maximum simplicity: You are adjusting only three parameters to get a fully working environment within a few seconds;</li>
	<li>Extensibility: Custom recommendations for host selection (for example - <strong>DRS</strong>), integration with external services (for example - <strong>IPAM</strong>), extrases (external helpers);</li>
</ul>
</p>
If you encounter these problems and want to relieve your life - then this is an article for you!

<p>
The API service architecture supports working both on a single node (when the API service and the hypervisor are combined), 
and allows you to use any number of nodes as hypervisors. 
We'll start by setting up a stand-alone cluster, especially since when switching to a multi-node option, all of these steps are still required.

<strong>private FreeBSD multi-node bhyve/jail cloud via API demo:</strong><br>

<p>
The service API architecture supports single-site and multi-site coverage, 
giving you the ability to easily create a private, programmable cloud to run virtualized environments, 
taking <strong>CBSD</strong>  to a new level of environmental management. 
In addition to the classic request over HTTP (for example, through the curl utility), 
the API is supported by a <strong>CBSDfile</strong>, which in some cases gives a very powerful 
and more convenient deployment of services in a private cloud. But more on that below.
</p>
<p>
Let's fix the terminology that will be used in this article.
<p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>CBSD</strong> - a set of scripts that implement virtual machine management at the lowest level.
		You need <strong>CBSD</strong> at least 13.0.1. If the version is lower, please upgrade before you start.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>ZPOOL</strong> - ZFS pool in which the <strong>CBSD</strong> working environment is initialized.
		By default, the <strong>CBSD</strong> working directory is initialized to <em>/usr/jails</em>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Broker</strong> - the main communication data bus between the cbsd-mq-api service (one) and cbsd-mq-router (can be in any quantity).
		In this article, <a target="_blank" href="http://xph.us/software/beanstalkd/">beanstalkd</a> serves as the broker.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Tube</strong> Tube (in beanstald terminology) - a FIFO queue/pipe in the broker, to which cbsd-mq-api writes (publish), and cbsd-mq-router reads (subscribe).
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Hypervisor (or hoster)</strong> (not to be confused with bhyve hypervisor) - a physical node running FreeBSD OS.
		The number of nodes is unlimited. Each hypervisor has at least 1 ZPOOL.
		Each pool is served by a cbsd-mq-router process that subscribes to a personal pool queue to process <strong>CBSD</strong> instructions.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>API</strong> - service (public) that provides RestAPI or json-rpc for interaction between end users (curl / UI frontend). 
		In our case, the simplest implementation will be the cbsd-mq-api service.
	</li>
</ul>

	<p>Let's start by looking at the simplest single-mode installation.</p>
	</div>
	<h2><a name="sapi"><span>Standalone API</span></a></h2>
	<div class="block">

	<p>Installing and configuring the <strong>CBSD</strong> API in standalone mode.</p>
	<p>In this example, all operations are performed on one hypervisor, which will act simultaneously as an API and a broker and a <strong>CBSD</strong> hoster, where working environments will be launched.</p>
	<p>Assuming you have a stock vanilla FreeBSD 13.0+ installation.</p>

	<p>1) Install additional packages:</p>
	<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
pkg install -y cbsd-mq-router cbsd-mq-api beanstalkd git
	</pre>
	<p>2) Configure beanstalkd, the broker service.</p>
	<p>Since all services are on the same server, we will specify the address 127.0.0.1 for incoming connections and start the service:</p>
	<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
sysrc beanstalkd_flags="-l 127.0.0.1 -p 11300"
service beanstalkd enable
service beanstalkd restart
	</pre>
	<p>3) Configure MQ router.</p>
	<p>First, get hoster FQDN via `hostname` command. Let's say your host has a name: <strong>apitest.my.domain</strong>
	<p>Open <em>/usr/local/etc/cbsd-mq-router.json</em> in any favorite editor and set "tube" and "reply_tube_prefix" params ( cbsd_<strong>&lt;hostname_without_dot&gt;</strong> and cbsd_<strong>&lt;hostname_without_dot&gt;</strong>_result_id ), e.g:
	<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
{
    "cbsdenv": "/usr/jails",
    "cbsdcolor": false,
    "broker": "beanstalkd",
    "logfile": "/dev/stdout",
    "beanstalkd": {
      "uri": "127.0.0.1:11300",
      "tube": "cbsd_apitest_my_domain",
      "reply_tube_prefix": "cbsd_cbsd_apitest_my_domain_result_id",
      "reconnect_timeout": 5,
      "reserve_timeout": 5,
      "publish_timeout": 5,
      "logdir": "/var/log/cbsdmq"
    }
}
	</pre>
	<p>4) Start MQ router:</p>
	<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
service cbsd-mq-router enable
service cbsd-mq-router start
	</pre>
	<p>5) Install CBSD API module.</p>
	<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
cbsd module mode=install api
echo 'api.d' >> ~cbsd/etc/modules.conf
cbsd initenv
	</pre>
	<p>6) Configure CBSD API module.</p>
	<p>Copy configuration sample to work dir:</p>
	<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
cp -a /usr/local/cbsd/modules/api.d/etc/api.conf ~cbsd/etc/
cp -a /usr/local/cbsd/modules/api.d/etc/bhyve-api.conf ~cbsd/etc/
cp -a /usr/local/cbsd/modules/api.d/etc/jail-api.conf ~cbsd/etc/
	</pre>
	<p>Open ~cbsd/etc/api.conf in any favorite editor and set "server_list=" to server FQDN, e.g:</p>
	<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
...
server_list="apitest.my.domain"
...
	</pre>
	<p>Set 'cbsd' user permission for ~cbsd/etc/api.conf file:</p>
	<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
chown cbsd:cbsd ~cbsd/etc/api.conf
	</pre>
	<p>Here you can check that the API module scripts works:</p>
	<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
su -m cbsd -c '/usr/local/cbsd/modules/api.d/misc/recomendation.sh'
	</pre>
	<p>must return the host from server_list ( <strong>apitest.my.domain</strong> )</p>
	<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
su -m cbsd -c '/usr/local/cbsd/modules/api.d/misc/freejname.sh'
	</pre>
	<p>must return the unique name '<strong>envX</strong>'.
	<p>7) Configure RestAPI daemon:</p>
	<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
mkdir -p /var/db/cbsd-api /usr/jails/var/db/api/map
chown -R cbsd:cbsd /var/db/cbsd-api /usr/jails/var/db/api/map
service cbsd-mq-api enable
service cbsd-mq-api start
</pre>
<p>
Your first standalone private API cluster of VM is ready to serve you!
</p>
	</div>
	<h2><a name="apij"><span>API: jail</span></a></h2>
	<div class="block">
<h3>Working with JAIL via the API</h3>

<p>Let's create a simple payload to create a container, for example, a jail.json file.
</p>
<p>jail.json:</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">

{
  "type": "jail",
  "imgsize": "10g",
  "pubkey": "ssh-ed25519 AAAA..XXX your@localhost"
}
</pre>
<p>
Of course, substituting your public key as pubkey. 
Let's send it to the endpoint for container creation, where /jail at the end means the name of the environment (arbitrary)
</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @jail.json http://127.0.0.1:65531/api/v1/create/jail
</pre>
<p>
In this case, the API will calculate the md5 hash from your pubkey and the result of the check-sum will automatically become your token, 
which you can use to control environments and at the same time will be a kind of namespace in the cluster, 
in which you will see all the resources created with your public key.
</p>
<p>
So, if you need to destroy the environment, use a GET request for the /destroy endpoint using your hash. Get the md5 sum of your key if you still don't know it;)
</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
md5 -qs "ssh-ed25519 AAAA..XXX your@localhost"
</pre>
<p>
use it in your request:
</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
curl -H "cid:90af7aa8bc164240521753a105df6a05" http://127.0.0.1:65531/api/v1/destroy/jail
</pre>
<p>
Of course, such a mechanism is only suitable for a private cloud. If you plan to raise 
a service for external users with a similar scheme, use more stringent validation methods to 
confirm dangerous operations, for example  <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-Time_Password">TOTP</a>.
</p>
<p>
A few more words about jail API configuration. 
A script working with jail via the API can use a configuration file named jail-api.conf, 
which must be located in the ~cbsd/etc directory. You can see an example of this file here: <em>/usr/local/cbsd/modules/api.d/etc/jail-api.conf</em>
</p>
At the moment the file regulates whether to allow the user to specify in the payload the FreeBSD 
version of the base for the container, the pool of IP addresses and the external IP address 
for accessing the container given to the user. By default, we do not skip the FreeBSD base 
version for the container, no matter what value the user sends: the API will create a 
container for the version of your hypervisor (ver=native). Since the user of the cloud 
does not influence the issuance of addresses, and <strong>CBSD</strong> does this, 
you can assign any pool, both external addresses and private ones.
</p>
	</div>
	<h2><a name="apib"><span>API: bhyve</span></a></h2>
	<div class="block">
<h3>Working with virtual machines bhyve via API</h3>
<p>
Working with virtual machines has a similar interface and endpoint, 
as in the case of jail, but has a slightly different payload for creating an environment. 
In addition, you must configure to match the name of the requested image with the <strong>CBSD</strong> profile. 
Like the jail script, the bhyve script also has a configuration file. Copy the example config file:
</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
cp -a /usr/local/cbsd/modules/api.d/etc/bhyve-api.conf ~cbsd/etc/
chown cbsd:cbsd ~cbsd/etc/bhyve-api.conf
</pre>
<p>
As in the case of jail, you can also regulate the rules for issuing IP addresses to virtual machines. 
And you can control which IP address will be given to the user for SSH access to the created resource 
- either the direct IP address of the virtual machine will be given, or <strong>CBSD</strong> will 
create an expose rule for SSH on any free port. In this case, the user will receive the IP address 
of the hypervisor and the port that will forward requests to the 22/ssh port of the virtual machine.
</p>
</p>
<p>
Payload example, e.g. centos7.json:
</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
{
  "type": "bhyve",
  "imgsize": "10g",
  "ram": "1g",
  "cpus": "2",
  "img": "centos7",
  "pubkey": "ssh-ed25519 AAAA..XXX your@localhost"
}
</pre>
<p>
And it is created by a similar request as jail:
</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @centos7.json http://127.0.0.1:65531/api/v1/create/cent7
</pre>

	<h2><a name="cbsdfile"><span><strong>CBSDfile</strong> + API</span></a></h2>
	<div class="block">
<p>
In some cases curl and RestAPI are much more convenient than ssh + `cbsd bcreate / bconstruct-tui`. 
If you have to deploy a lot of virtual environments and often, you cannot avoid the need to learn and use some high-level language.
CURL and HTTP requests are well suited if you develop a programmable cloud based on <strong>CBSD</strong>, but it's not very convenient for human.
As an intermediate option, we can offer the option of interacting with the API through the <a href="/<!--#echo var="lang" -->/cbsdfile.html"><strong>CBSDfile</strong></a>.
</p>
<p>
The API-enabled CBSDfile gives you the ability to easily build a private programmable cloud to run virtual environments because you can
fully describe in one file the finished a service (or several services) in a single virtual environment (or several virtual environments).
A similar tool is the <strong>nubectl</strong> - thin client, which described below.
</p>
<p>
If you are not familiar with this <strong>CBSD</strong> feature, be sure to check it out. 
In order to use the <strong>CBSDfile</strong> in your private cloud, you just need to add only two parameters to the beginning of the 
<strong>CBSDfile</strong> - this is the Endpoint of your API and the key. 
Having these two options will cause CBSD to switch from a local <strong>CBSD</strong> installation to the cloud when building. 
And this can provide a completely <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/lLdwzlCQaWY">new level of capabilities</a> (an example of interaction with a multi-node cluster)!
</p>
	</div>

	<h2><a name="mapi"><span>Multinode API</span></a></h2>
	<div class="block">

<h3>Multinode API/<strong>CBSD</strong> cluster</h3>
<p>
As stated earlier, the current architecture is capable of serving more than one hypervisor.
That, with intensive deployment of virtual environments in large numbers, can significantly increase the efficiency and efficiency of your cloud resources.
</p>
<p>
Our simple API service has the ability to use two external scripts that implement logic for two actions:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>a) suggest the following free name for the virtual environment. Taking into account several nodes, this solves the problem of possible collisions of names, since it is regulated at one point.</li>
	<li>b) get recommendations on which host the requested virtual environment should be placed on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any flight of imagination is given here for the implementation of logic in any programming language 
convenient for you and the use of any algorithms. So, for example, if some of your servers have 
high-performance but low-volume NVME disks and some of your servers have capacious but slow hdd, 
you can easily implement a simple logic like:
</p>
<p>
  > If a virtual machine with a disk capacity> 500GB is requested, select from the list of servers with <strong>hdd</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Together with the API module, two sh scripts are supplied, which, as examples, give a unique ID as a virtual machine name and a round-robin server issuing server. 
That should be enough to start a full-fledged multinode cluster in 10 minutes. Let's do that.
</p>
<p>
For simplicity and maximum freedom from dependencies, we will not use additional services or databases, we will manage with ordinary files and directory synchronization using the rsync protocol.
</p>
<p>Let's start by setting up the service API. In relation to the standalone configuration, in the ~cbsd/etc/api.conf file, 
we expand the list by the required number of members in the cluster, for example:
<pre class="brush:bash;ruler:true;">
server_list="srv-01.olevole.ru srv-02.olevole.ru srv-03.olevole.ru bob.your-server.de"
</pre>
<p>You can check that the recommendation script (/usr/local/cbsd/modules/api.d/misc/recomendation.sh) offers hosts in round-robin by default:</p>
